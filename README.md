## 📊 Dataset
 
**Source:** Black Friday Sales Dataset  
**Download:** [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13DxtCVj3S_AAYXG5THw2mmr6_VA1N3L9)
 
| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| User_ID | Unique customer identifier |
| Product_ID | Unique product identifier |
| Gender | M / F |
| Age | Age group (0-17, 18-25, 26-35, ...) |
| Occupation | Occupation code (0–20) |
| City_Category | City tier (A, B, C) |
| Stay_In_Current_City_Years | Years in current city |
| Marital_Status | 0 = Single, 1 = Married |
| Product_Category_1/2/3 | Product category codes |
| Purchase | Purchase amount in USD |
 
---
 
## 🔧 Key Preprocessing Steps
 
- **Missing values:** `Product_Category_2` and `Product_Category_3` filled with `0`
- **Encoding:** Gender → (M=0, F=1); Age groups → ordered integers (1–7); City → Label Encoded
- **Normalization:** Purchase amounts scaled using `StandardScaler`
- **Duplicates:** Removed all duplicate rows
- **Data type fixes:** `Stay_In_Current_City_Years` — `'4+'` replaced with `4`
 
---
 
## 📈 EDA Visualizations
 
- **Histogram** — Distribution of purchase amounts
- **Box Plots** — Purchase by Gender and Age group
- **Bar Charts** — Top product categories by total revenue
- **Scatter Plot** — Purchase vs Occupation
- **Correlation Heatmap** — Relationships between all key features

## 🔵 Clustering Analysis
 
**Algorithm:** K-Means  
**Optimal K:** 4 (determined via Elbow Method)  
**Features Used:** Age, Gender, Occupation, Marital Status, Normalized Purchase
 
| Cluster | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 💸 Discount Lovers | Low-spend, deal-seeking customers |
| 1 | 👑 Premium Buyers | High-spend, quality-focused shoppers |
| 2 | 🛒 Casual Shoppers | Moderate, infrequent buyers |
| 3 | 🔁 Frequent Buyers | Regular shoppers with consistent spending |
 
Clusters visualized in 2D using **PCA** projection.

## 🔗 Association Rule Mining
 
**Algorithm:** Apriori  
**Parameters:** min_support=0.05, min_confidence=0.3, min_lift=1.2
 
Finds product categories frequently purchased together.  
Rules evaluated using **Support**, **Confidence**, and **Lift** metrics.
 
Example rule: *"If a customer buys Category 1, they are likely to also buy Category 5"*
 
---
 
## 🚨 Anomaly Detection
 
**Methods Used:** Z-Score (threshold=3) and IQR (multiplier=1.5)
 
- Computes **total spending per user**
- Flags statistically unusual spenders
- Compares anomalies by Gender, Age, and Occupation
- Useful for identifying VIP customers for special loyalty programs
